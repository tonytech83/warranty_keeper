# WARRANTY KEEPER

My try to create a simple web app to care my warranties in one place.

Steps to perform:

1. Construct and create DB.
	- table for warranties
	  - date
	  - name
	  - description
	  - picture of warranty
	  
	- table for suppliers
	  - name
	  - mobile
	  - address
	
2. Ability to add warranty and/or supplier (if supplier not in the DB yet).

3. Email notification about expiring warranty.
